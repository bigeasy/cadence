Cadence is a control-flow library for error-first callback style of asynchronous
programming. Cadence is my solution to the problem of the [Pyramid of
Doom](http://tritarget.org/blog/2012/11/28/the-pyramid-of-doom-a-javascript-style-trap/).

Cadence is one step after another, with robust **try/catch** error handling for
asynchronous errors, **finalizers** for clean up, **nested** asynchronous
**loops** with **break and continue**, and **tail-recursion elimination** to
you'll never blow your stack looping.

Cadence does all this in **pure-Javascript** with **no transpilers** and without
ES6+ features. Cadence is classic Javascript. Cadence is tiny. Cadence is fast.

### Cadence In a Nutshell

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/bigeasy/cadence](https://badges.gitter.im/bigeasy/cadence.svg)](https://gitter.im/bigeasy/cadence?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Cadence runs a series of functions asynchronously, using the results of one
function as the arguments for the next. (This was inspired by Tim Caswell's
[step](https://github.com/creationix/step) module.)

We call the series of functions a **cadence**. We call an individual function in
a cadence a **step**.

We create **cadences** using the universal builder method `async`. We also use
`async` to create **callbacks** inside the **steps**. The `async` function is a
universal builder because we use it to create both **cadences** and
**calbacks**.

```javascript
// `cat`: write a file to a stream.
var cat = cadence(function (async, file, stream) {
                         // ^^^^^ our universal builder function.
    async(function () {
 //       ^^^^^^^^ create a cadence of one or more steps.
        fs.readFile(file, 'utf8', async())
                               // ^^^^^^^ create a callback.
    }, function (body) {
              // ^^^^ the result is passed to the next step.
        stream.write(body)

    })
})

cat(__filename, process.stdout, function (error) {
                                       // ^^^^^ any error, anywhere inside `cat` is propagated out
    if (error) throw error
})
```

Errors get propagated up and out of the function to the caller. The next
**step** does not receive an error argument and does not have to check the error
argument.

This menas that your code does not need to be littered with `if (error)
callback(error)` branches that are difficult to reach in your tests. This is a
major benefit of Cadence. Your asynchronous code is reduced to the happy path.

Here an example of a function that will return `true` if a regex matches the
contents of a file.

```javascript
var cadence = require('cadence'), fs = require('fs')

var grep = cadence(function (async, file, regex) {

    async(function () {

        fs.readFile(file, 'utf8', async())

    }, function (body) {

        return regex.test(body)

    })

})

grep(__filename, /readFile/, function (error, deleted) {
    if (error) console.log(error)
    else if (found) console.log('found readFile')
    else console.log('did not find readFile')
})
```

The Cadence function above returns a value to the user's callback. The result of
the function is the result of **cadence** defined in the function. The last
**step** of a **cadence** is the result of a **cadence**. The result of a
**step** is either results of any **callbacks** or nested **cadences**, or else
a value returned using `return`.

*TK: Stopped here. Keep rewriting.*

### Major Benefit: Try/Catch and Finalize

Cadence implements an asynchronous try/catch block that propagates error-first
callback errors and converts thrown exceptions into error-first callback errors.
When uses consistently, you end up with an asynchronous call stack.

```javascript
var cadence = require('cadence'), fs = require('fs')

var deleteIf = cadence(function (async, file) {

    async([function () {

        fs.unlink(file, async())        // try

    }, /^ENOENT$/, function () {

        return [ async.break, false ]   // catch ENOENT

    }], function () {

        return [ true ]                 // deleted

    })

})

deleteIf('junk.txt', function (error, deleted) {
    if (error) console.log(error)
    console.log('junk.txt: was deleted ' + deleted)
})
```

In the above we use a catch block to catch an `ENOENT` error and return `false`,
otherwise return `true`. If an error other than `ENOENT` is raised, the the
error will be passed as the first argument. The try/catch block is the try
**step** and the catch **step** paired together in an array. You can see how we
can return `async.break` from any **step** to leave the **cadence** early.

Until you use it, it is hard desrcibe how much easier it is to program
asynchronous Node.js when you have this asynchronous stack. You're no longer
dealing with mystery errors merging from a univeral error handler, your error
handing can have context; you know the nature of the error, because you know the
function you called that raised the error.

### What Cadence Can Do for You

*Ed: Older benefit list, all still true, but needs tidy.*

Cadence is pure-JavaScript library control-flow library with no transpilers. The
Cadence kernel is designed to JIT compile and get out of the way.

Cadence can express all manner of asynchronous operations, including:

 * serial asynchronous operations, of course
 * parallel asynchronous operations, naturally
 * `while` loops, `do..while` loops, or `counted` loops
 * each loops that can either map or reduce an array
 * `break` from labeled loops or `continue` them, even up out of nested loops to
   an outer loop
 * asynchronous try and catch exception handling
 * asynchronous finalizers for clean up

Cadence has features that you don't know you wantâ€¦ yet:

 * Have you been bitten by a stack overflow yet? Cadence runs your code in a
   trampoline, so that asynchronous functions that callback in the same tick do
   not add a stack frame.
 * Do you have a strategy to test every one of those `if (error)` branches?
   Cadence handles your errors for you and propagates them up and out to the
   user.
 * What about cleaning up after an error? You can't just `if (error)
   callback(error)` if you have files open or databases on the line. Cadence has
   try/catch blocks and finalizers.
 * Who is `this`? With Cadence `this` is consistent all throughout a function
   body. You don't have to `bind(this)` or `var self = this` with Cadence.

You can use Cadence in the browser too. It is not Node.js dependent and it
minzips to ~2.31k. Great for use with Browserfy.

## Cadence Step by Step

Cadence exports a single function which by convention is named `cadence`.

The `cadence` function is a function builder. It creates an asynchronous
function that expects an error-first callback as its final argument, the
asynchronous style used in many of the modules that ship with Node.js.

```javascript
// import cadence
var cadence = require('cadence'), fs = require('fs')

// create an error-first callback style asynchronous function
var find = cadence(function (async, path, filter) {

    async(function () {

        fs.readdir(path, async())

    }, function (list) {

        return list.some(filter)

    })
})

// call the function with function arguments and an error-first callback
find(__dirname, isJavaScript, function (error, found) {

    if (error) {
        console.log(error)
    } else if (found) {
        console.log(__dirname + ' contains a JavaScript file.')
    }

})

function isJavaScript (file) {
    return /\.js$/.test(file)
}
```

To learn more about Cadence, let's look closer at the `find` function.

### Function Body

We create the `find` function by invoking `cadence` with a single argument which
is the function body for `find`.  The `cadence` function will build a function
that, when invoked, will call the function body.

```javascript
var find = cadence(function (async, path, filter) {
                // ^^^^^^^^ function body
    async(function (  {

        fs.readdir(path, async())

    }, function (list) {

        return list.some(filter)

    })

})
```

### The `async` Function

The first argument to the body is the universal builder function which by
convention is named `async`. It is named `async` because anywhere you see it,
you know that something asynchronous is going on.

```javascript
var find = cadence(function (async, path, filter) {
                          // ^^^^^ universal asynchronous builder function.
    async(function () {
 // ^^^^^ it creates both cadences...
        fs.readdir(path, async())
                      // ^^^^^ ...and callbacks
    }, function (list) {

        return [ list.some(filter) ]

    })

})
```

### Steps and Cadences

When you invoke the `async` function with one or more functions, you create a
**cadence**. Each function is a **step** in the cadence.

```javascript
var find = cadence(function (async, path, filter) {

    async(function () { // <- let's create a cadence
       // ^^^^^^^^ step one
        fs.readdir(path, async())

    }, function (list) {
    // ^^^^^^^^ step two
        return [ list.some(filter) ]

    })

})
```

### Cadence Argument Progression

The results of one **step** in a **cadence** become the arguments of the next **step**.

```javascript
var find = cadence(function (async, path, filter) {

    async(function () {

        fs.readdir(path, async())
                      // ^^^^^ create a callback whose return value
    }, function (list) {
              // ^^^^ is the argument of the next step
        return [ list.some(filter) ]

    })

})
```

The `async` function is used to create a callback that is given to `fs.readdir`.
The next **step** is called with the result of the previous **step**, but
without the error. The error is shifted off the arguments so that the next
**step** receives no errors, only results. There is no error for the **step** to
check. There is no need for an `if (error)` at every **step**.

### Error Propagation

If an error does occur, it propagates out to the user. No matter how deeply
nested your **cadences**, an error will stop the **cadence** and return the
error to the user.

```javascript
var cadence = require('cadence'), fs = require('fs')

var find = cadence(function (async, path, filter) {

    async(function () {

        fs.readdir(path, async())
                      // ^^^^^ an error returned to any callback...
    }, function (list) {

        return [ list.some(filter) ]

    })

})

find(__dirname, isJavaScript, function (error, found) {
                                     // ^^^^^ ...propagates out to here.
    if (error) {
        console.log(error)
    } else if (found) {
        console.log(__dirname + ' contains a JavaScript file.')
    }

})

function isJavaScript (file) {
    return /\.js$/.test(file)
}
```

### Synchronous versus Asynchronous Steps

In our `find` function, we can see that there are two ways for a **step** to
produce a result.

When the `async()` function is called, a **callback** is created. The results
passed to the **callback** are the arguments given to the step. Alternatively,
the **step** can use `return` to retun an array of results where are used as the
argument to the next **step**.

```javascript
var find = cadence(function (async, path, filter) {

    async(function () {

        fs.readdir(path, async())
                      // ^^^^^ create a callback whose return value
    }, function (list) {
              // ^^^^ is the argument of the next step
        return [ list.some(filter) ]

    })

})
```

### Cadence Return Values

The results of the final **step** in a **cadence** are the results of the
**cadence**. In the case, the final **step** is a synchronous `return`, but the
final **step** could as easily be the result of another asynchronous call.

```javascript
var find = cadence(function (async, path, filter) {

    async(function () {

        fs.readdir(path, async())

    }, function (list) {

        return [ list.some(filter) ]
     // ^^^^^^ result of final step is the result of the cadence.
    })

})
```

The results of all the **cadences** and **callbacks** in the function body are
the results of the function generated by `cadence`.

```javascript
var cadence = require('cadence'), fs = require('fs')

var find = cadence(function (async, path, filter) {

    async(function () {

        fs.readdir(path, async())

    }, function (list) {

        return [ list.some(filter) ]
     // ^^^^^^ result of the only cadence...
    })

})

function isJavaScript (file) {
    return /\.js$/.test(file)
}

find(__dirname, isJavaScript, function (error, found) {
                                            // ^^^^^ ...is the result of function.
    if (error) {
        console.log(error)
    } else if (found) {
        console.log(__dirname + ' contains a JavaScript file.')
    }

})
```

## Cadence In Detail

*Ed: Hate to be a bum, but there needs to be some transition from the above,
which I believe does a good job, to the below, which allows us to look at finer
points.*

Now let's look at Cadence in some more detail.

We'll go over some of what we covered in Cadence Step by Step, but with
attention to detail using contrived examples that illustrate the point.

*Note: It is difficult to both illustrate the every edge case in the use of
Cadence and come up with real world examples that are concise. We're going to
show some trival functions that do frivolous things, but show you exactly how
Cadence works.*

We now get the gist of how Cadence uses **cadences** composed of **steps** to
create asynchronous control flows. Let's start looking at the details of control
flows and work toward advanced Cadence features.

### Our Friend Echo

In our detailed examples we are going to use a function called echo which will
invoke the callback with the argument given. We're also going to assume that we
have `ok`, `equal` and `deepEqual` to assert what we believe to be true.

```javascript
var ok = require('assert').ok
var equal = require('assert').equal
var deepEqual = require('assert').deepEqual

function echo (value, callback) {
    setImmediate(callback, null, value)
}
```


### Function Bodies with No Cadence

When you invoke `async` with no arguments, it builds a simple error first
**callback** function. Cadence will receive the results given to the
**callback** on your behalf and do the right thing.

```javascript
var minimal = cadence(function (async) {
    echo(1, async())
})

minimal(function (error, value) {
    equal(value, 1, 'called back')
})
```

In this case, we did nothing but call an asynchronous function giving it an
error-frist callback. It was the last thing we did so it became the result of
the generated function `minimal`.

Similarly, you can return a value from a Cadence function body using `return`.

```javascript
var minimal = cadence(function (async) {
    return [ 1 ]
})

minimal(function (error, value) {
    equal(value, 1, 'called back')
})
```

### More on Funtion Body Return Values

The results of all the **cadences** and **callbacks** in the function body are
the results of the function generated by `cadence`.

```javascript
var resulting = cadence(function (async) {
    async(function () {
        echo(1, async())
    })
})

resulting(function (error, value) {
    equal(value, 2, 'incremented')
})
```

### Creating Cadences

*Ed: This is duplicated, and dumb. Really, let's use the examples above to
introduce details, and as a later project make an all baby-steps walk through,
or maybe a more rule by rule walk though. Cadence Rule: A Function Body is a
Single Step, Cadence Rule: Asynchronous Trumps Synchronous, Cadence Rule: Always
Poke a Hamster.*

When you invoke `async` with one or more functions, you build a **cadence**.
Each function in the cadence is called a **step**.

```javascript
var stepper = cadence(function (async) {

    async(function () {
       // ^^^^^^^^ one or more functions creates a cadence.
        echo(1, async())

    }, function (value) {

        equal(value, 1, 'stepped')

        echo(value, async())
                 // ^^^^^ this will be the result of the cadence and the function.
    })
})

stepper(function (error, value) {

    equal(value, 1, 'called back')

})
```

### More on Propagating Errors

Any error or exception that occurs in the function body is propagated to the
caller by default.

```javascript
function brokenEcho (value, callback) {
    callback(new Error('out of service'))
}

var stepper = cadence(function (async) {

    async(function () {

        brokenEcho(1, async())
                   // ^^^^^ this callback will propagate the error.

    }, function (value) { // <- the next step will not be called because of the error.

        brokenEcho(value, async())

    })
})

stepper(function (error, value) {
               // ^^^^^ our error, propagated.
    equal(error.message, 'out of service', 'errors propagate')

})
```

### Propagating Exceptions

Exceptions are also propagated. You can throw an exception anywhere in the
function body and it will propagate out to the user as the error-first error.

```javascript
var stepper = cadence(function (async) {

    async(function () {

        throw new Error('out of service')

    }, function () { // <- will not be called.

        echo(1, async())

    })
})

stepper(function (error, value) {
               // ^^^^^ our exception, propagated.
    equal(error.message, 'out of service', 'exceptions propagate')

})
```

### Function Body Arguments

The first argument to the function body is always the `async` function. The rest
of the arguments are the parameters passed to the `cadence` generated function.

```javascript
var arguable = cadence(function (async, value) {
                                     // ^^^^^ from the caller.
    async(value, async())

})

arguable(1, function (error, value) {
      // ^ `value` parameter in `arguable`.
    equal(value, 1, 'argument passed')

})
```

### Variadic Functions

Because the error-first callback conventions dictate that the error-first `callback` is the
last argument, you might wonder why `async` is the first.

We put the `async` as the first argument, not the last, because Cadence is
nothing without its `async` function. We're (almost) always going to need it so
it will always be passed into the function body as the first argument.

Best of all, putting the `async` function at the head to make it easier to
implement variadic functions. No messy `var callback = vargs.pop()`.

```javascript
var argumentCounter = cadence(function (async) {

    var vargs = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
    async(vargs.length, async())

})

arguable('a', 'b', 'c', function (error, count) {

    equal(count, 3, 'three arguments')

})
```

A `cadence` generated function always expects a callback. There is
no concept of optional callbacks.

### Multiple Callback Arguments

Because error-first callbacks can receive multiple arguments, **steps** can
receive multiple arguments and a **cadence** can return multiple results.

Because a **cadence** can return multiple arguments a function body can also
return multiple arguments.

```javascript
function echo2 (one, two, callback) {
    setImmediate(callback, null, one, two)
}

var multi = cadence(function (async)
    async(function () {

        echo2('a', 'b', async())            // <- multiple results

    }, function (first, second) {           // <- multiple arguments

        assert(first, 'a', 'one of two in step')
        assert(second, 'a', 'two of two in step')

        echo2(first, second, async())       // <- multiple results returned

    })
})

multi(function (error, first, second) {     // <- multiple results received
    if (error) throw error
    assert(first, 'a', 'one of two results')
    assert(second, 'a', 'two of two results')
})
```

### Synchronous Steps Using `return`

Sometimes **steps** do not need to call asynchronous functions. In that case we can
simply use `return` to pass a value to the next **step**, but only if the value
is not an array.

```javascript
var synchronous = cadence(function (async) {

    async(function () {

        return 1                        // <- single value returned

    }, function (value) {               // <- single value received

        equal(value, 1, 'return number')

        echo(value, async())

    })

})

synchronous(function (error, value) {
    if (error) throw error
    equal(value, 1, 'sync worked')
})
```

### Returning Multiple Arguments from a Step

When we want to synchronously return multiple values, we return an array of
arguments. The elements in the array are used as the arguments to the next
function, much like calling `apply`.

```javascript
var synchronous = cadence(function (async) {

    async(function () {

        return [ 1, 2 ]                 // <- two values returned

    }, function (first, second) {       // <- two values received

        equal(first, 1, 'one of two')
        equal(second, 2, 'two of two')

        echo(first + second, async())

    })

})

synchronous(function (error, value) {

    equal(value, 3, 'multiple argument sync worked')

})
```

### Returning an Array from a Step

If you want to synchronously pass an array to the next **step**, you cannot
simply return the array, because the array elements will be used as the
arguments for the next **step**.

To synchronously pass an array to the next step, you return an array of
arguments that contians the array.

```javascript
var synchronous = cadence(function (async) {

    async(function () {

        var values = [ 1, 2, 3 ]

        return [ values ]           // <- array returned

    }, function (values) {          // <- array received

        ok(Array.isArray(values), 'is an array')
        equal(values.length, 3, 'is an array of three elements')

        echo(values.reduce(function (sum, value) { return sum + value }), async())

    })

})

synchronous(function (error, value) {

    equal(value, 6, 'array as a synchronous worked')

})
```

### Asynchronous Trumps Synchronous

Asynchronous trumps synchronous. If you create a callback or a **cadence** using
`async` inside a **step**, then the return value of the **step** is ignored.

```javascript
var trump = cadence(function (async) {

    async(function () {

        echo(2, async())        // <- callback created

        return 1                // <- value returned

    }, function (value) {       // <- callback value received, return value ignored

        equal(value, 2, 'async trumps sync')
        echo(value, async())

    })

})

trump(function (error, value) {

    equal(value, 2, 'async wins')

})
```

### Cadences within Cadences

You can create a **cadence** in a **cadence** and you will. You can create a
**cadence** in any **step**. The result of the **cadence** is passed as an
argument to the next **step**.

A **cadence** is an asynchronous operation that will trump a return values.

```javascript
var sync = cadence(function (async) {

    async(function () {

        async(function () { // <- a cadence in a step.

            echo(1, async())

        }, function (value) {

            echo(value + 1, async())
                         // ^^^^^ last callback of last step.
        })

    }, function (value) {

        equal(value, 2, 'sub-cadence output')
        echo(value, async())

    })

})

sync(function (error, value) {

    equal(value, 2, 'cadences within cadences')

})
```

Return values from **cadences** propagate up. Nest them as you see fit.

```javascript
var sync = cadence(function (async) {

    async(function () {

        async(function () {

            echo(1, async())

        }, function (value) {

            async(function () { // <- one step cadence, three cadences deep.

                echo(value + 1, async())
                             // ^^^^^ this result goes up two cadences.
            })

        })

    }, function (value) {

        equal(value, 2, 'sub-cadence output')
        echo(value, async())

    })

})

sync(function (error, value) {

    equal(value, 2, 'cadences within cadences')

})
```

### Cadences within Cadences: Practical Application

You will use **cadences** in **steps** in **cadences** to manage your scope. It
is a common construct.

In Cadence an indent means something. It means a new scope. You stay indented
when you have variables that need to be in scope for multiple asynchronous
operations. When the variables are no longer needed, the indent ends.

The following looks for the Unix execuable [magic
number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29#Magic_number).

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

// `sip`: sip the first `count` bytes of a file.
var sip = cadence(function (async, file, count) {

    async(function () {

        fs.open(file, async())

    }, function (fd) {
              // ^^ we need to use this for more than one step.
        async(function () {

            var buffer = new Buffer(count)
            fs.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length, 0, async())

        }, function (bytesRead, buffer) {
                  // ^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^  must close the file descriptor  before we can return these.
            async(function () {

                fs.close(fd, async())

            }, function () {

                return buffer.slice(0, bytesRead) // <- we're three cadences deep

            })

        })

    })

})

// sip two bytes of a file and look for the executable magic number.
sip(__filename, 2, function (error, value) {

    if (value.length == 2 &amp;&amp; value[0] == 0x23 &amp;&amp; value[1] == 0x21) {
        console.log('I have a shebang line!')
    }

})
```

### Fallthrough when a Step Returns Nothing

If you create a **step** that neither returns a value nor creates an
asynchronous operation using the `async` function, then the results of that
**step** are its arguments.

Put another way, if a **step** does not produce any results, then the **next**
step receives the results of the last **step** to produce results.

```javascript
var fallthrough = cadence(function (async) {

    async(function () {

        echo(1, async())

    }, function (value) {

        equal(value, 1, 'callback value')

        console.log(value)

    }, function (value) {

        equal(value, 1, 'callback value from step before last')

        return value + 1

    }, function (value) {

        equal(value, 2, 'returned value')

        console.log(value)

    }, function (value) {

        equal(value, 2, 'returned value from step before last')
                // <- no return or `async`, outcome is also a fall through.
    })

})

fallthrough(function (error, value) {

    equal(value, 2, 'fell through')

})

```

### Parallel versus Serial

The **steps** in a **cadence** run in *serial*, one step after another.

The asynchronous operations in a **step** run in *parallel*. An asynchronous
operation in a **step** is a **cadence** or a function that invokes a
**callback**.

If you see `async` in a **step**, something asynchronous is going on. If you see
more than one `async` in a **step**, something parallel is going on.

Multiple the results of multiple asynchronous operations in a **step** are
gathered and passed as arguments to the next **step**. The next **step** is not
called until all the asynchronous operations finish.

```javascript
var parallel = cadence(functions (async) {

    async(function () {

        echo(1, async())            // <- first async call.
        echo(2, async())            // <- second async call.

    }, function (first, second) {   // <- called when both echoes complete.

        return [ first, second ]

    })
})

parallel(function (error, first, second) {

    assert(first, 1, 'one of two returned')
    assert(second, 1, 'two of two returned')

})
```

The next **step** is called with the results of the mulitple **callbacks** or
**cadences**. The results are returned in the order in which their **callback**
or **cadence** was declared.

```javascript
var parallel = cadence(functions (async) {

    async(function () {

        var first = async()         // <- first callback.
        var second = async()        // <- second callback.

        second(null, 1)             // <- call second first, and right now.
        echo(1, first)              // <- call first on next tick.

    }, function (first, second) {

        assert(first, 1, 'first order of callback do not matter')
        assert(second, 2, 'second order of callback do not matter')

        return [ first, second ]

    })
})

parallel(function (error, first, second) {

    assert(first, 1, 'one of two returned')
    assert(second, 1, 'two of two returned')

})
```

*TK: But, parallel has changed.*

### Practical Application: Parallels as Funnels

*TK: Example of opening file and database.*

### Gathered Parallels

With gathered parrallels, instead of passing the asynchronous results into the
next **step** as individual arguments, they are passed as an array of arguments.

The asynchronous results of the **step** are gathered in an array and the array
is passed to the next **step**. The next **step** receives only one argument, an
array containing all the asynchronous results of the previous **step**.

We indicate that we want gathered results by placing an empty array after the
**step** whose results we want to gather.

```javascript
var parallel = cadence(functions (async) {
    var array = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]

    async(function () {

        for (var i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
            echo(array[i] + array[i - 1], async())
        }

        echo(1, async())            // <- first async call.
        echo(2, async())            // <- second async call.

    }, [], function (array) {       // <- called when both echoes complete.

        equal(array[0], 1, 'first element')
        equal(array[1], 2, 'second selement')

        return array.length

    })
})

parallel(function (error, length) {

    assert(length, 2, 'length of array')

})
```

You can probably imagine how when combinded with a loop, you could do a
reasonable amount of work in parallel.

```javascript
var parallel = cadence(functions (async) {
    var array = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]

    async(function () {

        for (var i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
            echo(array[i] + array[i - 1], async())
        }

    }, [], function (array) {       // <- called when both echoes complete.

        deepEqual(array, [ 3, 5, 7, 9 ], 'summed')

        return [ array ]

    })
})

parallel(function (error, array) {

    deepEqual(array, [ 3, 5, 7, 9 ], 'summed returned')

})
```

However, it is much better, I believe to do parallel work using a work queue,
which is why I've created [Turnstile](https://github.com/bigeasy/turnstile) and
[Reactor](https://github.com/bigeasy/reactor).

## Practical Example of Parallel Gathering: Directory Listings

**TK**

**TK: Although there are mechanisms for homogeneous parallel operations, that sort of
parallelism is best obtained at the serivce level. Instead of having a
highly-parallel directory listing in your web server, let your web server serve
many directory listings in parallel, each being worked through in serial. You
will get similar performance, but with a lot less complexity.*

The complexity comes in the error handling. If you can't read one file in a
directory, you probably can't read any of them. Now you have an array of errors
instead of an array of file statistics.

What we are discussing here are *heterogeneous* parallel operations, and they are
generally useful and easy to reason about. The make a lot of sense when you
need to to create funnel, performing multiple heterogeneous asynchronous
operations needed for the next **step**.

The following is a contrived initialization example.

```javascript
var initialize = cadence(function (async, conf) {

    async(function () {

        db.connect(async())                     // <- connect to database.
        fs.readFile(conf, 'utf8', async())      // <- *and* slurp configuration.

    }, function (conn, conf) {                  // <- initialize the connection
                                                //    with the configuration.
        conf = JSON.parse(conf)

        conn.encoding = conf.encoding || 'UTF-8'
        conn.lang = conf.lang || 'en_US'

        return conn

    })
})
```

### Breaking, Leaving a Cadence Early

You can leave a **cadence** by returning an array of arguments, the first
argument being the `async.break` property.

```javascript
var early = cadence(function (async) {
    async(function () {

        return [ async.break, 2 ]   // <- the `async` means break.

    }, function () {

        echo(1, value())            // <- never called.

    })
})
```

You will use this construct all the time to end loops. You will also use it to
return early when you catch an exception.

The following is example of returing cached asynchronous operation early.

I've said that asynchronous trumps synchronous, but `return` trumps anything
that follows it. That is why `return` makes for a nice break construct.

```javascript
var fs = require('fs'), cadence = require('cadence'), config

module.exports = cadence(function (async) {

    async(function () {

        if (config) return [ async.break, config ]

        fs.readFile('./config.json', 'utf8', step())

    }, function (body) {

        return [ config = JSON.parse(body) ]

    })

})
```

### Forever Loops

A loop is a **cadence** that repeats itself. When we create a **cadence**, the
`async` function returns a loop function that we can use to invoke the
**cadence** as a loop.

By convention, we call this loop function immediately.

This is an endless loop. In order to leave the loop we need to break from the
**cadence**.

```javascript
var loopy = cadence(function (async) {

    var count = 0

    async(function () {

        if (count == 10) {
            return [ async.break, count ]   // <- break and return count.
        } else {
            count++
        }

    })()
   // ^^ loop forever.
})

loopy(function (error, value) {

    assert(value, 10, 'looped')

})
```

### Loop Arguments

You can pass arguments into a loop by passing them to the loop constructor.

On subsequent iterations the arguments after the index argument are the results
of the previous iteration, the previous invocation of the **cadence**.

```javascript
var reduce = cadence(function (async) {

    var index = 0
    async(function (sum) {
                 // ^^^ initial argument or result of last iteration.

        if [ index == 5 ] return [ async.break, sum ]
        else return sum + index++

    })(0)
    // ^ initial argument.
})

reduce(function (error, value) {

    assert(value, 10, 'reduced sum')

})
```

### For Each Loops

You can create for each loops using `cadence.forEach`. The `cadence.forEach`
function returns a loop initializer function. You call it with an array of items
to iterate over. Iteration is serial, one item after the next.

The argument given to the loop body is the value of the current array element
followed by the current index.

```javascript
var sum = cadence(function (async) {
    var sum = 0
    async.forEach(function (value) {
        return sum + value
    })([ 1, 2, 3, 4 ])
})(function (error, sum) {
    if (error) throw error
    assert(sum, 10, 'reduce')
})

sum(function (error, value) {

    assert(value, 10, 'summed')

})
```

### Each Loop Index Argument

The second argument to an each loop **cadence** is the index of the entry in the
array.

```javascript
var sum = cadence(function (async) {

    var sum = 0

    async.forEach(function (number, index) {
                         // ^^^^^ index of array entry.
        return sum + (number - index)

    })([ 1, 2, 3 ])

})

sum(function (error, value) {

    assert(value, 3, 'sum of ones')

})
```

### For Each Loop Additional Arguments

You can pass arguments to the for each loop **cadence** by passing them in after
the each loop array.

The arguments after the array argument are the arguments passed to the loop
starter on the first iteration.

On subsequent iterations the arguments after the index argument are the results
of the previous iteration, the previous invocation of the **cadence**.

```javascript
var reduce = cadence(function (async) {

    async.forEach(function (number, index, sum) {
                                        // ^^^ initial argument or result of last iteration.
        return sum + number

    })([ 1, 2, 3 ], 0)
                 // ^ initial argument.
})

reduce(function (error, value) {

    if (error) throw error
    assert(value, 10, 'reduced sum')

})
```

### Mapped Loops

You can perform asynchronous array mapping using `async.map`. The result of the
mapping is passed  to the next **step**. Just as in `async.forEach`, the first
argument is the array alue,

```javascript
var squares = cadence(function (async) {

    async.map(function (value, index) {

        return value * index

    })([ 1, 2, 3 ], 3)
    // ^^  ^ gather a counted loop.
})

squares(function (error, array) {

    deepEqual(array, [ 0, 2, 6 ], 'mapped')

})
```

### Loops Nested in Cadences

All of the above loop examples can be used in any **step** in any **cadence**,
not just the function body.

Loops can contain loops.

```
var multiply = cadence(function (async, matrix) {
    async(function () {
        var i = 0, j = 0
        async(function () {
            if (i == matrix.length) return [ async.break ]
            async(function () {
                if (j == matrix[i].length) return [ async.break ]
                echo(matrix[i][j] * 5, async())
            }, function (value) {
                matrix[i][j] = value
                j++
            })()
        }, function () {
            j = 0
            i++
        })()
    }, function () {
        return [ matrix ]
    })
})

multiply([[ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 7, 8, 9 ]], function (error, matrix) {
    if (error) throw error
    deepEqual(matrix, [[ 5, 10, 15 ], [ 20, 25, 30 ], [ 35, 40, 45 ]])
})
```

The above is a contrived example that multiples each element in an array of
arrays by five. It is much easier to express using `async.map`.

```
var multiply = cadence(function (async, matrix) {
    async.map(function (array) {
        async.map(function (value) {
            echo(value * 5, async())
        })(array)
    })(matrix)
})

multiply([[ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 7, 8, 9 ]], function (error, matrix) {
    if (error) throw error
    deepEqual(matrix, [[ 5, 10, 15 ], [ 20, 25, 30 ], [ 35, 40, 45 ]])
})
```

## The Rules of Cadence

Here is Cadence presented as a set or rules to follow. It acts as both a
refernece and a glossary. Ordering is subject to change.

The first argument to a cadence funtction body is the universal builder function
async.

A Cadence function body is a cadence with a single step.

Result of a Cadence function is the result of all cadences and steps in the the
function body.

Notes: Terminating an asynchronous stack.
