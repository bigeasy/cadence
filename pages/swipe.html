<div class="markdown"> Cadence is a small JavaScript library (well, function) that enables defining flow/control structures using callbacks. By providing a series of callback functions, you can have your functions executed in absolute order with the return values of the previous respective functions. This is useful when the callback syntax of JavaScript combined with various looping structures obfuscates code; Cadence abstracts away your looping construct and allows you to declare and/or call each function inline, without messy indents from various callbacks. Thus, the layout of your code much more clearly reflects the flow of your program.

Besides using multiple top-level cadences, Cadence is flexible enough to allow you to nest so-called "sub-cadences" in such a way that allows you to avoid ugly callback-within-a-callback-within-another-callback structures.. within your callback. This is useful because it allows you to write complex asynchronous code without the ugly aesthetics usually involved. Also, keep in mind that while your parent or 'outer' cadence is dependent on your sub-cadences to move forward, sub-cadences are not dependent on each other; this means that Cadence can - and will - run your sub-cadences in parallel.

While Cadence gets rid of your loop declarations and syntax, it does not *restrict* your looping constructs in any way - writing a map or reduce still works the same, and you can still specify how long a cadence should loop for if you want. You can instruct Cadence to build an array of all of your return values, and if you do not then Cadence will give you back the value of the very last run of that loop. Cadence can also infer the arity of the functions you provide it, but it is possible to explicitly inform Cadence to pass a specific number of arguments along. There are other aspects of Cadence to round it out and provide various utilities, like specifying "finalizer" functions, labeling functions for reuse in loops or other sub-cadences, or using a sub-cadence to sort of "pause" the control flow, execute a function, and then let Cadence continue. </div>
